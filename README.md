# ML Approach w/ Titanic Dataset in Python

## Executive Summary:

...

Yes, the Titanic Dataset is a ginormous cliche in the data science world.  However, it has earned that cliche status by being a dataset (and story!) that is well-understood by most everyone.  As such, it is an excellent dataset to use to illustrate my ML Approach. 

Decision trees are one of my favorite ML models to use.  I find that they work well for a majority of predictive business problems regardless of the industry.  Also, their "if this than that" path through the tree makes intuitive sense to individuals of all levels of ML literacy, making it easy to explain the model to stakeholders.

### Next Steps: 

1. Since there are no photos of the items, add string fields fully describing each item.  This is also a value-adding accessibility feature!  
2. Enhance user account functionality to allow potential new users to browse items without needing a login.  Requiring a user login to view the products is a barrier that could deter potential new customers, frustrate current customers who've lost their login, and reduce sales.
3. Allow for personalization of each item with custom text entered by the user at the time of order.  Limit customization to a length appropriate for the size of the item.
